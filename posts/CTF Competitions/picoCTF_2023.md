Starting the instance we were given ssh credentials to connect to, now lets connect

>command: ssh picoplayer@saturn.picoctf.net -p 53271

cool, we are logged in. Looking at the description of the challenge it says "**_How to automate tasks to run at interval on linux servers?_**". What came to mind when I saw this was a cronjob.

><font color="Green">A cronjob is a task or command that is scheduled to run automatically at specific intervals on a Unix or Linux system. Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix and Linux operating systems, which allows users to schedule jobs or scripts to run automatically at specified times or intervals. A cronjob consists of a set of instructions or a script that tells the system what to do and when to do it. For example, a cronjob could be set up to run a backup script every night at midnight or to update a database every hour.</font>

Now we can view a cronjob running when we reapicoCTF{Sch3DUL7NG_T45K3_L1NUX_1b4d8744}d the contents of the ```crontab``` file in the ```/etc``` directory.

cool, we got the flag

We also got another ssh instance to connect to, lets go ahead and connect 

>command: ssh picoplayer@saturn.picoctf.net -p 60852

Checking the description of the challenge, it says "**_can you read files in the root file?_**". 

To read root files means we have to escalate our privileges to that of the root user. Running the command ```sudo -l``` I found something interesting

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226692873-fe1c6200-3eec-472a-b07c-c5219739b736.png)

This means we can run the binary ```vi``` as root on the system using sudo. Going to GTFOBins I found the right payload to use

payload:```sudo vi -c ':!/bin/sh' /dev/null```

boom!!! we got a shell as root and also got our flag which was in the ```/root``` directory.

ohh nice hehe, we were given a base64 encoding. Lets go ahead and decode this. We'll be using cyberchef for this

We had to decode with base64 six times to get the flag ðŸ˜‚

I was almost stuck here lool, but then I checked the challenge tags again and saw ```man```.

><font color="Green">On a Linux system, the man command is used to display the manual pages (or "man pages") for a given command or topic. To use the man command, you simply type "man" followed by the name of the command or topic you want to learn about</font>

running the command ```man useless```
