Starting the instance we were given ssh credentials to connect to, now lets connect

cool, we are logged in. Looking at the description of the challenge it says "**_How to automate tasks to run at interval on linux servers?_**". What came to mind when I saw this was a cronjob.

<font color="Green">A cronjob is a task or command that is scheduled to run automatically at specific intervals on a Unix or Linux system. Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix and Linux operating systems, which allows users to schedule jobs or scripts to run automatically at specified times or intervals. A cronjob consists of a set of instructions or a script that tells the system what to do and when to do it. For example, a cronjob could be set up to run a backup script every night at midnight or to update a database every hour.</font>

Now we can view a cronjob running when we reapicoCTF{Sch3DUL7NG_T45K3_L1NUX_1b4d8744}d the contents of the ```crontab``` file in the ```/etc``` directory.

We got a hint that said "**_Some crypto-currencies abuse databases exist; check them out!_**"

Then I went to google and got this url https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/

Lets paste the bitcoin address in here

At the bottom of this page we find the link that says more information here: https://blog.avira.com/petya-strikes-back/ 

Navigating to that link

Reading more about petya

<font color="Green">Petya is a type of malware that was first discovered in 2016. It is a ransomware that encrypts the entire hard drive of an infected computer, making it impossible for the user to access any files or data stored on it. The malware demands a ransom payment in exchange for a decryption key to restore access to the encrypted files.</font>

I think we found our flag

Checking the description of the challenge, it says "**_can you read files in the root file?_**". 

To read root files means we have to escalate our privileges to that of the root user. Running the command ```sudo -l``` I found something interesting

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226692873-fe1c6200-3eec-472a-b07c-c5219739b736.png)

This means we can run the binary ```vi``` as root on the system using sudo. Going to GTFOBins I found the right payload to use

payload:```sudo vi -c ':!/bin/sh' /dev/null```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226693886-1777095f-1c1f-4a4e-8f1f-96fe1cde9d92.png)

boom!!! we got a shell as root and also got our flag which was in the ```/root``` directory.

I was almost stuck here lool, but then I checked the challenge tags again and saw ```man```.

<font color="Green">On a Linux system, the man command is used to display the manual pages (or "man pages") for a given command or topic. To use the man command, you simply type "man" followed by the name of the command or topic you want to learn about</font>

Now that we are logged in, I tried running common linux commands like ```cd```,```ls```,```pwd``` but I was getting some errors

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226753673-e768a547-7795-4a5c-8537-63301d9248a2.png)

Going back to the challenge descriptionn, this is a Spell Check Interface for affecting Linux, with this every word is properly spelled and capitalized, this is why when we ran the ```pwd``` command we got the ```Pod``` not found this is because there was automatic correction anc capitalization of the first word.

Checking the hints we have "**_Experiment with different shell syntax_**". After lots of research I found something similar to a command execution. What this means is that we get to use the double underscore (__).

<font color="Green">In a Linux shell, the double underscore (__) is not a command, but rather a convention used to indicate special variables or functions.</font>

>command: __|whoami

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226758471-3849129e-b6cb-4cc7-9719-5a3a42b2eb63.png)

We got ourselves a command injection. This means we can now run linux commands. But there is still an issue, we can only run single commands like ```ls```,```pwd```,```id```,```whoami```, when we try to run ```cd /home``` we get an error

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226760641-8bf878f9-4217-43a4-a3e8-e1a76e4f3ce7.png)

After googling stuffs, I found out that if i run ```__|ls "-la"``` I won't get an error

cool, from the above screenshot we can see that ```blargh``` is a directory now lets go ahead and read the flag file. Since this is a CTF competition I assumed the flag name to be "flag.txt"

>command: __|cat "blargh/flag.txt"

cool, we found our flag

Navigating to the webpage

We get a login page, lets login with the credentials they provided for us

```username:user```       ```password:user```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226994081-3408837c-a3e9-4c41-af38-0c91c74e366b.png)

cool, we are logged in. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226994203-125363aa-3e65-431c-b58a-1e97486609e1.png)

You'll get this page when click on the flag pdf, so we don't have the permission to view the pdf. Lets capture the request on burpsuite

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226994602-f9857df6-1731-4126-a1c3-e0a5671c4429.png)

Sent the request to burp repeater

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/227001894-9a0d577f-e787-4ae5-8428-c2e134c1ce3c.png

So I changed the directory. You can also see that we have a jwt token, lets try to read the pdf file called flag, as you can see it has an ```id``` of ```5```. So, navigating to this directory ```/base/books/pdf/5``` we'll try to read the file. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/227002348-981b9f6c-d20c-4c9a-829d-972078cd7d81.png)

oops, we got an error that says "**_Access Denied_**". Lets try to decrypt the jwt token to see what it stores

Link: https://jwt.io

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226996480-b4aee037-a980-46e4-ae4c-a6492e288858.png)

So, this jwt token stores information, but looking at the end of the screenshot we see the ```invalid signature``` message, this means even if we make some changes to the informations the token won't still be valid if we don't provide a secret key. 

Checking the hints provided, "**_Maybe try to find the JWT Signing Key ("secret key") in the source code? Maybe it's hardcoded somewhere? Or maybe try to crack it?_**"

So what I did was to crack it, I used a tool called ```jwt-cracker```

You can download it here: https://github.com/lmammino/jwt-cracker

```
cool, we found the secret key which is ```1234```, now lets apply this as we change some of the informtation the token stores. To be able to view the pdf flag file we have to change the role to ```Admin``` and also change the userId to ```2```. 


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226999491-ac22249c-4792-4555-a9e9-f5d276b4ead8.png)

cool, if you observer the signature is now verified. Lets copy this new token and replace it with the former one that was there

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226999770-4ae36d7d-3eb4-46f0-87d8-82982a2c7e89.png)

I replaced the jwt token already, from the above screenshot you'll see that to be able to read the pdf called flag the ```id``` number is ```5```. So to read this you'll change the directory to this ```/base/books/pdf/5```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/227000191-251acf61-67d9-4fd8-bb0b-2abf00ab66dc.png)

As you can see we aren't getting the error we got the first time we tried it, so this means we can now view the pdf called flag. Using the search box lets search for the word ```pico``` since that's the word the flag starts with

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/227000589-16e12156-e6cb-4ed6-805e-611eb7c517bf.png)

cool, we got our flag. This challenge was actually an interesting one ðŸ™‚
