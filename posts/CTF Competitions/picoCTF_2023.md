Starting the instance we were given ssh credentials to connect to, now lets connect

cool, we are logged in. Looking at the description of the challenge it says "**_How to automate tasks to run at interval on linux servers?_**". What came to mind when I saw this was a cronjob.

<font color="Green">A cronjob is a task or command that is scheduled to run automatically at specific intervals on a Unix or Linux system. Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix and Linux operating systems, which allows users to schedule jobs or scripts to run automatically at specified times or intervals. A cronjob consists of a set of instructions or a script that tells the system what to do and when to do it. For example, a cronjob could be set up to run a backup script every night at midnight or to update a database every hour.</font>

Now we can view a cronjob running when we reapicoCTF{Sch3DUL7NG_T45K3_L1NUX_1b4d8744}d the contents of the ```crontab``` file in the ```/etc``` directory.

cool, we got the flag

We got a hint that said "**_Some crypto-currencies abuse databases exist; check them out!_**"

Then I went to google and got this url https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/

Lets paste the bitcoin address in here

At the bottom of this page we find the link that says more information here: https://blog.avira.com/petya-strikes-back/ 

Navigating to that link

Reading more about petya

<font color="Green">Petya is a type of malware that was first discovered in 2016. It is a ransomware that encrypts the entire hard drive of an infected computer, making it impossible for the user to access any files or data stored on it. The malware demands a ransom payment in exchange for a decryption key to restore access to the encrypted files.</font>

I think we found our flag

We also got another ssh instance to connect to, lets go ahead and connect

Checking the description of the challenge, it says "**_can you read files in the root file?_**". 

To read root files means we have to escalate our privileges to that of the root user. Running the command ```sudo -l``` I found something interesting

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226692873-fe1c6200-3eec-472a-b07c-c5219739b736.png)

This means we can run the binary ```vi``` as root on the system using sudo. Going to GTFOBins I found the right payload to use

payload:```sudo vi -c ':!/bin/sh' /dev/null```

boom!!! we got a shell as root and also got our flag which was in the ```/root``` directory.

I was almost stuck here lool, but then I checked the challenge tags again and saw ```man```.

<font color="Green">On a Linux system, the man command is used to display the manual pages (or "man pages") for a given command or topic. To use the man command, you simply type "man" followed by the name of the command or topic you want to learn about</font>

running the command ```man useless```

Now that we are logged in, I tried running common linux commands like ```cd```,```ls```,```pwd``` but I was getting some errors

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226753673-e768a547-7795-4a5c-8537-63301d9248a2.png)

Going back to the challenge descriptionn, this is a Spell Check Interface for affecting Linux, with this every word is properly spelled and capitalized, this is why when we ran the ```pwd``` command we got the ```Pod``` not found this is because there was automatic correction anc capitalization of the first word.

Checking the hints we have "**_Experiment with different shell syntax_**". After lots of research I found something similar to a command execution. What this means is that we get to use the double underscore (__).

<font color="Green">In a Linux shell, the double underscore (__) is not a command, but rather a convention used to indicate special variables or functions.</font>

>command: __|whoami

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226758471-3849129e-b6cb-4cc7-9719-5a3a42b2eb63.png)

We got ourselves a command injection. This means we can now run linux commands. But there is still an issue, we can only run single commands like ```ls```,```pwd```,```id```,```whoami```, when we try to run ```cd /home``` we get an error

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226760641-8bf878f9-4217-43a4-a3e8-e1a76e4f3ce7.png)

After googling stuffs, I found out that if i run ```__|ls "-la"``` I won't get an error

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/226761409-0ff7db7c-0032-49cb-9197-e1cdf9703222.png)

cool, from the above screenshot we can see that ```blargh``` is a directory now lets go ahead and read the flag file. Since this is a CTF competition I assumed the flag name to be "flag.txt"

>command: __|cat "blargh/flag.txt"

We can use the ```echo *``` to list directories and use ```echo */*``` to list files under the directories
